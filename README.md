## Conversation Starters - Project 1 (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Web APIs, Server-Side APIs)

- *What was your motivation?*  We wanted to create a website to help people with conversation starters after 2.5 years away from steady socialization
- *Why did you build this project?*  To help people have one less thing to stress about when going out and meeting new people or going back into the office.  We take care of the conversation starters. 
- *What problem does it solve?*  It solves the problem of trying to think of small talk with people at work or social functions
- *What did we learn?* We learned how to work as a team and to troubleshoot code and GitHub together. We learned how to divide up tasks so that everybody contributes evenly. We learned how to create a modal in html and populate it using JavaScript. We learned how to create different branches and how to merge files and resolve conflicts in GitHub.
